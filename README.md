## 📸 Screenshots

Add screenshots to the `assets/` folder and reference them from this README. Recommended filenames:

- `assets/screenshots/login.png` — Login page screenshot
- `assets/screenshots/register.png` — Register page screenshot
- `assets/screenshots/dashboard.png` — Dashboard screenshot

Recommended image sizes for README display:
- Width: 900px (max) — scales nicely on GitHub and keeps layout clean
- Height: auto — preserves aspect ratio

Markdown example (place these inside this README where you want the images to appear):

```markdown
### Login Page
![Login Page](assets/screenshots/login.png)

### Register Page
![Register Page](assets/screenshots/register.png)

### Dashboard
![Dashboard](assets/screenshots/dashboard.png)
```

If you prefer to control size in HTML (works in some markdown renderers):

```html
<p align="center">
	<img src="assets/screenshots/dashboard.png" alt="Dashboard" width="900" />
</p>
```

Notes:
- Use descriptive alt text (helps accessibility). Example: `alt="Goalify dashboard showing calendar and todo list"`.
- Keep actual screenshot files inside `assets/screenshots/` to stay organized.
- If images don't load on GitHub, ensure the files are committed and pushed to the repository and that the paths match exactly (case-sensitive on some platforms).
